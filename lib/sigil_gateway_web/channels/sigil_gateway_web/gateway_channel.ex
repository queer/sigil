defmodule SigilGatewayWeb.GatewayChannel do
  @moduledoc """
  Channel used for managing gateway connections

  Some general design notes:
  - We can't tag sockets etc. due to the distributed nature of the gateway, so
    we solve it by using etcd and redis
  - To handle fanouts, since we can't be lazy butts and assume everything is
    connected to one gateway, we:
  1. Take the fanout input request
  2. Send a pubsub over redis to fanout to all gateway nodes
  3. Gateway nodes fanout to clients
  The idea is that we can do a relatively-cheap backend fanout to reach all
  clients, and clients themselves can decide if theywant to do something with a
  given event, rather than trying to locate a specific client connected to a
  specific gateway.
